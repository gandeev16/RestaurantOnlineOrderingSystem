What have you done personally since your last progress report?
I have been working on checkout page and menu page since our last progress report. I am also getting started on the admin panel where
admin module will work with special username and password and admin will have special privileges like adding, updating and deleting
categories, products in the website. As we are approaching to the end of the semester, so we might not be able to complete the coding for
the admin module.

Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.
As a team, we have tested and completed the database connection with our signup and login page. We have also been able to come to a 
agreement with our masterpage which will give consistent site wide page layout to our webpage. We have also completed our menu page 
which is a section containing food and drink items with brief description and price listed next to it. We are in final stage of coding for 
the project's add to and remove from cart page.
