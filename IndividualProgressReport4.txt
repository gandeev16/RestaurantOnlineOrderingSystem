1. What have you done personally since your last progress report?
- I have been working to fix the bugs in our program and also working on
  the admin panel where admin can add, update and delete new categories 
  products in the website.I am also working on the report and final presentation.

2.Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.
- We have been able to complete the user and admin module of the project. In user 
  module, one can become member of the site using signup page, login to the website and
  view and add products to the cart. After placing order, users will see order number and
  order details. In admin module,admin can add, update and delete new categories and 
  whatever is added by admin will automatically be shown to the user.
